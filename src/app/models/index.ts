/**
 * Prviously, I have messed up the definition of models, I have defined so
 * many models which does not have corresponding existence on server side.
 *
 * The models we defined here at client side, should matches database table
 * entries or joined tables on server side. When dealing with those models,
 * we choose part of the entries we want to process, instead of dividing
 * them into small pieces, such as model 'User' should be used in login,
 * register, jwt and user info related area, so no separate 'Login',
 * 'Register', 'JWT' module should exists.
 *
 * AFAIK, Client side model is a projection of server side tables/jointed tables
